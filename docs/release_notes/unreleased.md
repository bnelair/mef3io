# Unreleased

Changes merged since the last release. Rewritten into the next version's
notes at release time. These changes target **2.0.0** (breaking).

## De-identified copies keep the times unless you ask for a shift

`anonymize_session` no longer requires a shift. **Without one (the new
default) the copy keeps every date and time exactly**, so it still shows when
the recording was made; the patient's identity is removed exactly as before
(names, ID, location, session name, descriptions, annotation text by default,
new identifiers, other programs' private data cleared, provenance
`anonymize`). Give a shift, as before, to hide the dates.

- **Python:** `mef3io.anonymize_session(src, dst, shift_us=None, ...)`,
  `mef3io.anonymize.check(src, dst, shift_us=None, ...)` and
  `mef3io.anonymize.verify(src, dst, shift_us=None, ...)`. `None` (or leaving
  the argument out) = times kept; an int = every time moved by it, with all
  the rules that applied before. `AnonymizeReport.shift_us` is `None` for a
  copy that kept the times, and `summary()` says so.
- **Command line:** `python -m mef3io anonymize SRC DST` now works without
  `--shift-us` / `--reference-date` and keeps the times.
- **C++:** `AnonymizeOptions::shift_us` and `AnonymizeReport::shift_us` are
  `std::optional<si8>` (unset = times kept); `verify_anonymized` takes a
  `std::optional<si8>`; `check_anonymize` lost its `check_shift` parameter
  (the options' shift decides).
- **What a copy that keeps the times holds:** every stored time byte for
  byte as in the source, and each segment's `recording_time_offset` (the
  stored times are read against it, so keeping it is what keeps the times).
  `GMT_offset` and the daylight-saving fields are still cleared: they can say
  where the recording was made, and no time a reader returns depends on them.
  Its verification requires every time (file headers, block index, data
  block headers, annotation headers and index, the times inside
  annotations) and every offset to equal the source's.
- **Only with a shift:** the shift rules (`shift-zero`, `shift-below-floor`,
  `shift-not-positive`), the recording-time-offset refusals
  (`rto-disputed`, `rto-unreadable`, `time-before-rto`), `id-number-time`,
  `time-overflow` and the time leak scan. A copy that keeps the times copies
  each time and offset as stored, so a session with segments that disagree
  on the offset, or with times in the ambiguous legacy convention, can now
  be de-identified without a shift (its times read back exactly as the
  source's). No refusal code was added or removed.

### Migration

- **Code that always passes a shift is unaffected**: a shifted copy is made,
  checked and verified exactly as before.
- **Anything that relied on the shift being required** (a script or form
  that treated a missing shift as an error) now makes a copy with the REAL
  dates. If the dates must not be shared, pass `shift_us` (or
  `--reference-date` / `--shift-us`) explicitly.
- **`anonymize.check(src, dst)` without a shift changed meaning.** It used
  to check a shifted copy with the shift still to be chosen; it now checks
  the copy that keeps the times, so it no longer reports the shift-only
  refusals listed above (for example `rto-disputed` or `time-before-rto`). To
  check a shifted copy, pass the shift you will use.
- **`anonymize.verify(src, dst)` without a shift** checks a copy that keeps
  the times; pass the shift to verify a shifted copy (it was required
  before).
- `shift_us=0` is still refused (`shift-zero`); leave the shift out to keep
  the times.
