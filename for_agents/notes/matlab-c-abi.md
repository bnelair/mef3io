# MATLAB binding and C ABI

- **MATLAB binding implemented**: flat C ABI (`core/include/mef3io/c_api.h`,
  Catch2-tested) → single command-dispatch MEX (`matlab/mef3io_mex.cpp`) →
  `+mef3io` Reader/Writer classes. Build with `matlab/build_mex.m` (C++20
  compiler; do NOT add -fvisibility=hidden — it hides the MEX version symbols
  → "not supported in current release"). `matlab/test_mef3io.m` = round trip;
  validated cross-language both directions vs Python/pymef with R2026a.
  Append-overlap check has half-a-sample-period slack (per-block half-us time
  rounding can store a segment end ~1 us past the grid-exact end).
